## MERN Stack Overview

The MERN stack is a popular technology stack for building full-stack web applications. It consists of four main technologies:

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js that provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications.
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser.

The MERN stack allows for the development of modern, scalable web applications with JavaScript across the entire stack.

## Deployment Steps

To deploy the Hotel Booking System project, follow these steps:

1. **Set up a MongoDB database**: Create a MongoDB database to store hotel and user data.

2. **Clone the repository**: Clone the project repository to your local machine using the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

3. **Configure environment variables**: Set up environment variables for MongoDB connection strings, API keys, and other sensitive information.

4. **Install dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies for both the client and server:

    ```bash
    cd hotel-booking-system
    npm install
    cd client
    npm install
    ```

5. **Build the React app**: Build the React app for production:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

6. **Start the server**: Start the Node.js server:

    ```bash
    cd ..
    npm start
    ```

7. **Access the application**: Access the deployed application by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

## Hotel Booking System Explanation

The Hotel Booking System is a web application that allows users to search for hotels, view hotel details, and book rooms. Key features of the system include:

- **Search functionality**: Users can search for hotels based on location, date, and other criteria.
- **Hotel details**: Users can view detailed information about each hotel, including amenities, room types, and pricing.
- **Booking**: Users can book rooms at their chosen hotel for specified dates.
- **User authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their account details.

The system is built using the MERN stack, providing a scalable and efficient architecture for managing hotel data and user interactions.

## Pipelines and Hooks

Pipelines and hooks are essential concepts in modern web development and version control systems like Git. In the context of this project:

- **Pipelines**: Pipelines refer to automated workflows that execute a series of predefined steps, such as building, testing, and deploying code changes. Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines help streamline the development process and ensure code quality.
- **Hooks**: Hooks are functions that allow developers to access and manipulate the lifecycle of components in React.js. They enable developers to add stateful logic and side effects to functional components, improving code reusability and maintainability.
